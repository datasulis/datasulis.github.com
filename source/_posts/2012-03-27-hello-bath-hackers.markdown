First post!

This site is an experiment in creating a collection of useful pointers, blog posts, datasets and maybe even APIs for local hackers in Bath. As I've explained a little in the [about][1] page I'm interested in exploring how a more local, city level view of Open Data could help support some interesting innovative hacking amongst the local geek community.

As the recent [Bath Digital Festival] has shown Bath has developed a really amazing local tech community. [WeLoveBath] also shows that Bath has a great community of engaged citizens. But I've not seen any efforts to start curating local datasets that can help both of those communities do interesting, innovative things in our local area. 

This site sets out to see if we can remedy that. Basically, I've spent a lot of time over the last few years doing data modelling and munging and I decided its time to use those skills for good :)

I expect this will be something of a journey and I'm hoping that some of you out there will want to join in and help out. I'm hoping that if its successful then maybe we can run a BathCamp or hackday dedicated to local data projects.

It doesn't matter if your a geek or not I'm hoping that we can explore lots of ways to curate and collect local data. I'm as interested in running some local crowd-sourcing experiments as I am in wrangling data from various APIs.

The project is intended to be open from top to bottom, so all of the content, source code and data should be up for re-use. 

Lets see what we can make.
