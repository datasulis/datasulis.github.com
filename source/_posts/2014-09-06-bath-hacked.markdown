Its beeen over two years since I posted to this blog. At the time I had good intentions that I was going to post regularly and try my best to start an open data community here in Bath. Unfortunately, as always happens real life interviewed: a few months after this happened I changed job and became [freelance](http://consulting.ldodds.com/) with the result that I had no time for side projects as I was taking on as much work as possible to get the business started.

I've never completely given up on the idea behind Data Sulis though. While I've not had much time to do visible work I've continued to research open datasets that might be useful to the local community. My work with the Open Data Institute and others has also given me some useful experience.

I was about to kick-start this project again when I discovered [Bath: Hacked](http://www.bathhacked.org/). It turns out that I'm not the only person passionate about open data in Bath and they've been extremely busy!

The [@BathHacked](http://twitter.com/BathHacked) team have been working with B&NES to open up some datasets. After a succcessful hack day early this year they've now launched [a beta data store based on Socrata](data.bathhacked.org).

As a result of this I've been reworking the code in the [DataSulis github account](https://github.com/datasulis) to add support for posting the data to Socrata. I've also been spending time exploring the Socrata platform. I've also agreed to help manage the BathHacked store to help people get the most out of it and ensure that the datasets are well-published.

There's some interesting datasets in the store already, including some continuously updated air quality data taken from sensors around the city. B&NES are now running an [air quality hack day](http://www.bathhacked.org/news/air-quality-hack-20-september/) to encourage developers to use the data in the BathHacked store to build some interesting applications.

While I'll be blogging on the Bath Hacked website and contributing to [the BathHacked github project](https://github.com/bathhacked) I'm going to revive this project and hopefully blog here a little more frequently. I'll be using it to publish my personal perspective on open data, investigations of useful datasets, and updates on my own hacking with local open data.
